TextBack
========

TextBack is an Android(4.0+) app that texts for you when you can't. It's essentially an e-mail autoresponder, except for SMS messages.
You can create custom messages to send or use predefined templates. TextBack also has an optional web component that allows you
to start the app remotely from a web interface. This is especially helpful if you left your phone at home/can't find it.
Start textback remotely and stop worrying about not responding to SMSs from friends/colleagues.

Caveats
=======

Though TextBack responds to SMS messages, those messages don't show up in your conversation list.
It's on the list of things we want to add, but couldn't figure it out.
